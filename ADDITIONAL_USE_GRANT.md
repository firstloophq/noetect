# Additional Use Grant (Summary)

This document is a **plain-English summary** of the “Additional Use Grant” section in `LICENSE`.
If there is any conflict, **the `LICENSE` file controls**.

## What you can do (allowed)

You may use, modify, and fork this project.

You may also use it in **production** for:

- **Personal use**
- **Internal business use** (including within your corporate group / affiliates)

“Internal” means it supports your organization’s operations and is not operated for outside customers.

## What you cannot do (without a commercial license)

You may **not** do any of the following for or on behalf of third parties:

- Deploy/install/configure the software for clients as part of consulting or professional services
- Operate or manage it for clients (managed service / MSP style)
- Offer it as SaaS / hosted access for third parties
- Bundle it into a paid product or paid access offering where this software is a substantial part of the value

If you want to do any of the above, you need a **commercial license** from the Licensor.

## Why this exists

The goal is to allow broad personal and internal business usage, while preventing agencies and service providers from monetizing deployments to external clients without a commercial agreement.

## How to get a commercial license

See `COMMERCIAL.md`.
