  Caret AI, Inc dba Firstloop  (the entity that owns the copyright)

Licensed Work:
  Noetect (the “Licensed Work” is the software and associated materials
  in this repository, excluding any Third-Party Materials identified in NOTICE
  files, if any)

Additional Use Grant:
  You may make production use of the Licensed Work solely for:

  (a) Personal Use; and
  (b) Internal Business Use.

  “Personal Use” means use by an individual for their personal, non-third-party
  purposes.

  “Internal Business Use” means use solely for the internal operations of you
  and your Affiliates, and not for or on behalf of any Third Party.

  “Affiliate” means any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is
  controlled by, or is under common control with a party.

  “Third Party” means any individual or entity that is not you or your
  Affiliates.

  The following are NOT permitted under this Additional Use Grant (and therefore
  require a commercial license from the Licensor):

  (i) providing, deploying, installing, configuring, operating, hosting,
      managing, or supporting the Licensed Work for or on behalf of any Third
      Party, including as part of consulting, professional services, managed
      services, systems integration, outsourcing, or similar service
      arrangements;

  (ii) making the Licensed Work available to any Third Party as a hosted or
       managed service (including SaaS), whether or not such service is charged;

  (iii) distributing the Licensed Work (or a modified version) to a Third Party
        as part of a paid offering where the Licensed Work is a substantial
        component of the value delivered (including bundling into a paid product
        or paid access arrangement), except that redistribution remains
        permitted for non-production use as provided by the Terms below.

  For clarity: internal hosting or operation of the Licensed Work by one team
  for another team within the same organization (including Affiliates) is
  “Internal Business Use” and is permitted.

  Four years from the date the Licensed Work is published (for each version of
  the Licensed Work).
